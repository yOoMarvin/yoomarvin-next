        <Paragraph>
          I’m a digital creator based in Mannheim, Germany. Currently doing my
          Master's Degree at the University of Mannheim and working for the
          innovation lab of the Sparkasse Versicherungen. I mainly work on
          digital products from start to finish and solve problems with the help
          of technology and design.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Before that I’ve studied Business Informatics at the DHBW in Mannheim
          and developed my own little projects.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          Beside that, I enjoy spending time to the next generations of
          designers and developers. Learning a lot of awesome things and create
          wonderful projects with talented people.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          In my spare time I am a passionate yogi and runner. I also like to
          visit awesome places with awesome people. A dog and some human friends
          are also involved in my life. Both groups are very nice to me.

        <Paragraph>
          I love helping designers, engineers, and founders in any way I can. I
          like to do this in two ways:
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          1. My{" "}
          <a
            href="https://twitter.com/yoomarvin"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Twitter DMs
          </a>{" "}
          are open. Let me know how I can help, ideally with specific questions
          or problems you're working through. I can be helpful in thinking about
          job interviews, product presentations, design work, working at
          startups vs. large companies, being a developer/designer hybrid,
          working in the open source community, building side projects, and
          podcasting. If I don't reply right away, please follow up – sometimes
          things slip through the cracks! But I'll do my best to reply quickly.
        </Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>
          2. If you find yourself in Mannheim, I'd love to meet you for coffee.
          I like to do this on Wednesday afternoons each week, for about an
          hour. Just shoot me an email or DM on Twitter and we can find a time.
          This hour will be most productive if there are specific questions or
          problems you’d like to talk about. Of course, I won't always have
          answers, but I think I can be a helpful listener and bounce questions
          back at you to hopefully provide logical next steps to pursue. If
          you’d rather just meet and chat casually, that’s fine too!
