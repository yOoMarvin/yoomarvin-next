          I love helping designers, engineers, and founders in any way I can. I
          like to do this in two ways:

            Twitter DMs
          </a>{" "}
          are open. Let me know how I can help, ideally with specific questions
          or problems you're working through. I can be helpful in thinking about
          job interviews, product presentations, design work, working at
          startups vs. large companies, being a developer/designer hybrid,
          working in the open source community, building side projects, and
          podcasting. If I don't reply right away, please follow up â€“ sometimes
          things slip through the cracks! But I'll do my best to reply quickly.

          2. If you find yourself in Mannheim, I'd love to meet you for coffee.
          I like to do this on Wednesday afternoons each week, for about an
          hour. Just shoot me an email or DM on Twitter and we can find a time.
          This hour will be most productive if there are specific questions or
          problems youâ€™d like to talk about. Of course, I won't always have
          answers, but I think I can be a helpful listener and bounce questions
          back at you to hopefully provide logical next steps to pursue. If
          youâ€™d rather just meet and chat casually, thatâ€™s fine too!
