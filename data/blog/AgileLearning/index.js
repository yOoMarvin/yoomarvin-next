  **tl;dr** Using agile methods for things like exam phases works wonders if you want to visualize your progress and actions.

Oh boy, it’s that time of the year again. After my first big exam phase within my master’s degree I’ve learned a ton of things and in the past, I’ve also made several mistakes I won’t make again 🤦‍♂️. One of them was losing the overview of things that need to be done, things that are in progress, things that needed review and also things that were finished. Well, now you might think: Dude did you actually learn?! Point for you. 🤫

Taking a closer look at these problems they can actually be solved with a pretty easy methodology. Learning in an agile way. If you are into software development only a little, you already heard of things like Kanban or Scrum 🙌. And now I get the chance to try something new in the upcoming exam phase! 

The most important for me part is to visualize everything related to an exam on a little board 👀. Well, I didn’t want to stick to a specific process here so I kept everything veeeery lightweight. That’s why I’ve decided for the following boards: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done. Grab some post its and write some actions and BAM 🚀! You got a board with all of your tasks and your progress. The first days feel a lot more structured now and I’m excited how this thing will continue 🎉. Now the stuff just needs to go into my head...

Keep Creating✌️
