Hey there üëã

Summer is here. And how it is here. Between writing books and reading (or listening to) books, I have been outside a lot. I actually read less than I had thought. But now I also know how much time marathon training actually takes. The goal of reading 50 books this year still looks good. But I have to keep at it. In total, I have read 3 books this month. 2 of them were even non-fiction. I have now reached 35 books for this year.

## 1. [Why We Sleep](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34466963-why-we-sleep) by Matthew Walker

I recently listened to the audiobook version of ‚ÄúWhy We Sleep‚Äù by Matthew Walker and was amazed by how much I learned. Walker dives deep into the science of sleep, explaining why it‚Äôs so essential for our health and well-being.

Although the numerous studies can make it feel a bit dry at times, the wealth of information is incredibly valuable. Walker‚Äôs insights into how sleep affects everything from our memory to our immune system are eye-opening.

Overall, you definitely come away with a better understanding of the importance of good sleep habits.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. Informative and enlightening, even if a bit heavy on the science.

## 2. [The Dark Forest](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23168817-the-dark-forest) by Cixin Liu

I just finished the second part of the Trisolaris Trilogy, ‚ÄúThe Dark Forest,‚Äù and it‚Äôs been a bit of a rollercoaster. I was really excited to dive into it, and for the first two-thirds, it didn‚Äôt disappoint. The story had me hooked, especially the Wallfacer plotline, which kept me intrigued and eager to see how things would unfold.

But then, after the whole cryosleep section, things started to get confusing and a bit too strange for my taste. The plot took some unexpected turns that left me scratching my head more than once. It‚Äôs still an interesting read, but it definitely lost some of the momentum that made the first book so compelling.

Despite that, I‚Äôm still curious enough to check out the third part of the trilogy, though at this point, I‚Äôm thinking the first book was the strongest of the series.

I‚Äôd give ‚ÄúThe Dark Forest‚Äù 3 out of 5 stars. It‚Äôs got its moments, but it doesn‚Äôt quite live up to the brilliance of the first installment.

## 3. [Die Geschichten in uns](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/213069372-die-geschichten-in-uns) by Benedict Wells

How refreshing that was. I have to admit that I've been itching to start writing for a long time. Talking about it is easy for me, but actually doing it is hard. It's even more beautiful somehow when you can procrastinate with a book and let so many thoughts wander around the topic.

I simply think that Benedict Wells is a really great author, and in this book, it feels like you can learn directly from him a little bit. The tips are sometimes very practical, sometimes more theoretical. What you definitely find here, though, is a lot of passion and plenty of reading tips.

But enough writing for now. 4/5 ‚≠ê
