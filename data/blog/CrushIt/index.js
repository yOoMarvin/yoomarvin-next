  **tl;dr** Finished my second book in my reading challenge! 10 / 10 🔥

A few weeks ago I’ve started the #100DaysOfReading challenge 💯. Just because I really want to get a regular reading habit and to build this step by step. So, 100 days, everyday 1 hour. I’m now nearly 3 weeks into it and finished TWO BOOKS 🤯! For me, a person how buys a book and never touches it or falls asleep right after 2 pages, this is AMAZING 👍! But I think I can still top this… I’ve recently finished one of the best books I’ve ever read! _Crush It_ by _Gary Vaynerchuk_ 🙏 Yes, I know it is a bit old BUT it’s still a great book with a lot of value 📚 I found myself taking notes and making little annotations like never before in a book. I think it’s not a book, IT’S A LESSON! I can’t wait to dive into the new version Crushing It. But before that I’m making a big move and try to read 2 BOOKS AT ONCE 😱! Firstly: _The Design of Everyday Things_ by _Don Norman_ 🎨, which is one of the must-read design books actually! And secondly: _Born to Run_ 🏃‍♂️. Also one of the 100 books you ‚should have read‘. So, let’s start strong in the new week! I’ll keep you up to date with the challenge and my journey! All updates are also available on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoomarvin)

Keep creating. Peace ✌️
