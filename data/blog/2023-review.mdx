As we bid farewell to 2023, I'm taking a moment to reflect on a year that has been a remarkable blend of professional milestones and personal achievements. I have made it a tradition to do this every year, and this year I have decided to share it publicly.

## Work

The year began with a flurry of freelancing projects that were as diverse as they were challenging. Each project was a unique canvas, allowing me to push my creative boundaries and explore new facets of design. I'm very grateful to have helped some companies and teams with their product design challenges. Freelancing offered significant growth opportunities, and I learned valuable lessons from each project.

I think one of my biggest passions at work is one of my side projects: teaching at [Memorisely](https://www.memorisely.com/). All the bootcamps were a highlight, engaging with such vibrant and eager minds kept me on my toes and reaffirmed my love for teaching. I was surprised by how much stuff I'm learning myself! Each session was a two-way street of knowledge and fun, and I can't wait to do more of it! I think we have some very cool plans for Memorisely in the next year, and I'm so happy to be a part of this team!

We also had another special thing at Memorisely. [Our very first team workation](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18378394990034685/?hl=de). The week spent in London with the Memorisely team was nothing short of magical. It was an incredible blend of teamwork, creativity, and exploring the nuances of design. That week alone added a year's worth of memories!

And then there was also another thing that completely changed my professional life. Transitioning to a full-time role at [RTL+](https://plus.rtl.de/). As a Senior Product Designer, I'm now part of a team that's shaping the future of entertainment. Every day is a new challenge, a new opportunity to create something impactful. And I'm here for all of it. I mean, I even got the chance to do a [workshop with Figma there](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QGWD6EhhKYE). How cool is that?

## Private Life

Moving to the countryside was a decision that brought an unexpected serenity to my life. The quiet mornings, the scenic landscapes, and the slower pace of life have been a soothing balm to the soul. It's a lifestyle change I didn't know I needed until I experienced it. I enjoy how the slower pace of life influences other aspects of my life. For instance, I now listen to more music on vinyl and read more books.

This year, I turned pages after pages, devouring over 30 books. From fiction to design, each book opened up new worlds and ideas. Rediscovering my love for reading has been one of the year's most fulfilling aspects, and I'm already eyeing my next stack of books.

I dabbled in a few side projects as well. Though I put them on the back burner for a bit, they're simmering with potential. In 2024, I plan to bring these ideas to fruition and share them with you all.

## Outlook 2024

As I step into 2024, I'm excited to continue my journey with RTL+. We've got some amazing projects lined up, and I'm eager to see where we can take them. I'm actually really happy with the decision to fully focus on one project and team now!

Teaching Design Systems at Memorisely is something I'm particularly looking forward to in January. I can't wait to dive back into the world of education and interact with more passionate designers.

A personal goal for the year is to run a marathon. It's a daunting challenge, but I'm all geared up for the training and the triumph.

One of my side projects is close to being ready for launch. It's something I've been passionately working on, and I can't wait to share it with you all. üõ†Ô∏è

And lastly, I'm looking to dive back into music. It's time to reconnect with my musical roots and explore this creative outlet once again.

2023 was a year of embracing new paths, rediscovering old passions, and making unforgettable memories. I'm grateful for all the experiences and for your support along the way. Here's to a fantastic 2024!

Cheers to more adventures and creativity.
Oh, and keep creating awesome stuff!
