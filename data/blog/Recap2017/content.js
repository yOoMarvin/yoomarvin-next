My first exam phase in university is finally over and the Christmas holidays are coming to an end. Now, this weird time in between the years starts. But it's a good time to reflect what has happened in the past 12 months. Things that went well and things where you can improve. So, let's grab the reading glasses and do a little recap of my 2017.

### Learn and build. Build and learn
If I would have to describe my 2017 in only two words this would be very simple for me: **Build and learn** (or maybe the other way around). This was actually the core of the year. And it was a really awesome year. 12 months in which I've learned a ton of awesome stuff, built amazing things and just tried things out. But let's start at the beginning. 

With the start of 2017, I've made a very good decision, because I've decided to enter the #100DaysOfCode challenge. A project where I was going to code each day for at least 1 hour on private projects. And that 100 days in a row. The goal was actually just to get more comfortable and try out some stuff but it leads me to a whole new direction in coding. After the 100 days, I'm now really comfortable with iOS Development and Swift and the love continues until today. You can read more about my journey and my projects in another [blog post](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/coding/2017/04/30/100DaysOfCode.html) from me. Looking back now, I think this was one of the best decisions I've made. And who knows... maybe I will go into round 2 in 2018 to learn something new...

Learning was really one of the key aspects in 2017 for me. I've learned a ton of new things in my job and had a lot of great opportunities. This year definitely made me a better designer and developer, just by building things from the ground up. I also like mentoring people. I know that I still need to learn a lot and by far I'm not a guru of any kind. But just bringing new people to this whole digital pioneer thing is amazing. Talking about your experiences and see other people learn just makes me happy. I hope that I can continue with that in the next year.

Besides from my day to day job I've also made another very important decision. Because I want to continue learning and dig a bit deeper into things, I've decided to start my Master's Degree in September this year. A good decision? Well, I cannot say that with 100% clarity. The first semester felt very theoretical and the exam phase was brutal. I wouldn't say that I have learned really new stuff, but I think this will get better with the new semester. I've already read about awesome new lectures and cool projects, so I'm really excited for that!

### Going long, going far
Besides coding and designing I'm also trying a lot of other stuff and in 2017 I've discovered a new passion for sports. I'm quite an active person and I did a lot of yoga and body weight training over the year, which is an awesome type of exercising. But something was missing for me here... So I've tried out something new and discovered a new kind of sports that really challenges me in a mental and also physical aspect. Running. Sounds simple but I love it. I even want to go one step further in 2018 by diving into triathlon training. Maybe I will keep you up to date about that on my blog, too. Maybe a little sports corner. 

With that, I just want to remind you that you should always try to get out of your comfort zone. Try new stuff, make new experiences and you will definitely will make use of it in somehow! 

### And 2018?
Well, the question is now... What does 2018 hold for me? Of course, I want to learn even more in 2018! As I've said before, maybe with another challenge. Maybe I will sneak out of my Swift cave and dive a bit more into advanced frontend stuff and react/react native. That would be pretty cool! 

I also have some project things to do! First I want to update my website and blog. Just polish some things and give this whole place a new look! This will be my first focus in 2018. Afterwards, I have two little side projects in my head. One for getting better in design and illustrations and one app idea. Today, those are just some rough ideas but I will soon put my thoughts out on paper and start creating! 

And one aspect is really important for me in 2018. **Productivity**. I want to make sure to get the most out of time! Recently I've changed up my morning Routine with the help of the Developer Tea podcast (which is an amazing podcast btw.). I see and feel the benefits from it just after some weeks. So I will definitely stick to that in 2018! 

Oh and I also want to work more on my meditation practice because I lack continuity here. Physical and mental health is really important to me and I just feel that I should do more on the mental side of things. 

### Until then
So, this was my little recap of 2017 and my plans for 2018. After being absent from this blog for some weeks it feels good to be back and to put out more posts in the future. I'm excited how this whole thing here will develop. Thank you for reading. I hope you enjoyed it. 

I wish you all the best for 2018! Keep creating awesome stuff!
