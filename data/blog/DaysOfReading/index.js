  **tl;dr** I’ve decided to commit to the #100DaysOfReading by reading everyday at least 1 hour in a book of my choice.

  You know that feeling, piles of books get bigger and bigger and you somehow just don’t have the time to read them all🤯 Or, in my case… procrastinate until they are falling into dust. BUT not anymore! Last year I did the **100DaysOfCode** Challenge 👨‍💻 which was an amazing journey with tons of stuff I’ve learned. Actually, it built a really good habit for me and I’m coding now almost every day. Now what? Transfer that to reading! 📚That’s why I’ve decided to the 100DaysOfX Challenge. Well, in my case the X stands for Reading. My task now? Reading EVERYDAY for at least 1 hour and that for 💯 Days! All progress will be made public on my [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yoomarvin) and sometimes on my journal here! Let’s grab the reading glasses and start killing it! 🤓  
  
  Keep creating. Peace ✌️
