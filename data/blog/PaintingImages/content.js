**tl;dr**. I’m dropping the pseudo beautiful images and rather post graphics.

Ok, let’s try something out. In my last post I’ve written about a little (or big) shift I’m wanting to do with my blog and all this stuff 🔧
At the same time, I’ve also mentioned those little updates and mini posts I’ve started on Instagram a few weeks ago. And you know what? I’m really enjoying this! 🤙 

BUT (of course) there is one thing. The visuals. I know, I know, Instagram is a platform with mainly visual content. But I just don’t have the time, passion and skills to take perfectly lighted photos every day 🤯 That’s not where my focus is. My focus is on the content. The thing here. The lines you’re reading write now. And you made it until here. So… it’s kind of working. 

Long story short. I’m going bolt here by dropping the image part. Wow, take it slow. That would be crazy. I’m rather going to try to make little graphics with text, weird forms or quotes about the posts content. Think of it like a theme or a ONE WORD summary. 🎨 Hopefully something that will grab your attention. Anyways, let’s see how this will work out! 

Keep creating. Peace ✌️`;
