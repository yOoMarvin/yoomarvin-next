Today's post will be a little be different and rather short. Actually, it is just a short message I want to put out there. For the next few weeks, I will put the blog post things on hold. This is mainly because of the upcoming exam phase at the university. There is a ton of things to learn and I need to be focused 110% on those. But! I have big things in my head when I'm back in mid-December.

First, there will be a big new project that will be made public with the start of the new year. Be excited about that. The first little steps resulted in great feedback so far. Of course, I will make sure to keep you up to date with everything that happens.

Another thing is a little podcast idea I'm planning with a colleague and friend of mine. Nothing special so far, just some vague ideas. But hey, you never know what 2018 will hold for you.

And the last very exciting thing... I will make another redesign and rework the complete concept of this blog. Don't be worried. The posts will continue. Maybe even more frequent than now. But I just want to put things on a higher level visually. The plan is to release the new version of my digital home at the end of the year. So I have something to do for the holidays.

Of course, I will keep you up to date on every little step I make. Thank you for reading this! I'm really excited about the future. Big things will happen!
Keep creating awesome stuff!
