_Marvin's Monthly Book Bites is a monthly newsletter I started in 2024 to share the books I've read over a month. [You can subscribe to updates here](https://world.hey.com/mrvn)._

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

So, this is it. I have found myself sitting in a chair reading a lot since the start of the new year. There is no particular goal or reason behind it. I just discovered great books with a huge impact. And because I also love to share the things I'm discovering over at [my weekly newsletter, Pixel Perfect Picks](https://world.hey.com/mrvn), I thought it would be a cool idea to share what I'm reading here more specifically. Let's see how this goes.

In January 2024, I've read a total of 7 books, with 2 nonfiction books and 5 fiction books. There is one for every type of reader, I guess. Let's go!

## 1. [Measuring The World](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/642231.Measuring_the_World) by Daniel Kehlmann

I still remember schoolmates in another class speaking about this totally boring book that they are reading in school right now. Yep, that's it. Isn't it fascinating how your view completely changes on something within 12 years? And how different something feels if you don't have to do it? That's exactly the case with this book.
"Measuring the World" takes readers on a captivating journey through the lives of two brilliant minds as they challenge the conventions of their time, pushing the boundaries of science and exploration. Overall, I have to say that I really liked it. The stories in the book feel very light, and the overarching story builds slowly, but in the end, it has a great touch. If you're interested in nature, exploration, and history, give it a try.

## 2. [Eine Frau und ein Mann](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/202995857-eine-frau-und-ein-mann) by Niklas Maak & Leanne Shapton

I think there isn't a German version of this book, but I really hope that there will be a translation. Basically, the story is very simple. It is a nonfiction book about two of the greatest inventions of our time: the car and the cinema. In vividly described road trips, Niklas and Leanne drive famous routes from even more famous movies. He drives, she paints. The result is this book, which tells the stories they experience on their journey. And it's not only enjoyable to read, but also simply a beautiful book. Period.

## 3. [Melody](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/75369851-melody) by Martin Suter

"Melody" is a captivating novel that weaves a tale of intrigue and mystery around the profound impact of a unique and unforgettable melody on the lives of those who hear it. I can't remember the last time I was so engrossed in a book. I believe I read it in just two days and was absolutely fascinated. And the best part: while reading, I never felt like I was reading. I was completely immersed in the story, which ultimately shows what a brilliant author Martin Suter is. I hope there will soon be an English version available for this as well!

## 4. [1984](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/61439040-1984) by George Orwell

A true classic. This book is a powerful and thought-provoking dystopian novel that explores the dangers of totalitarianism and the loss of individuality in a world dominated by surveillance, propaganda, and control. Just now, the book has aged incredibly well. Actually, not at all if you ask me. The topics addressed here have also occupied me for quite some time.

## 5. [Klara And The Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54120408-klara-and-the-sun) by Kazuo Ishiguro

I have heard many good reviews for all of Ishiguro's books. That's why this one landed at the top of my reading stack. "Klara and the Sun" is an evocative and poignant tale that delves into the depths of love, morality, and what it means to be human, all through the eyes of Klara, an observant and empathetic artificial intelligence. It's such an interesting but also current topic that really makes you think. It's both wonderful and wonderfully sad at the same time.

## 6. [Building A Second Brain](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/59616977-building-a-second-brain) by Tiago Forte

Okay, let's dive into the nonfiction area. This and the next book can't be found in the picture above, as I read it on my Kindle. I find it much more comfortable to read nonfiction books on my Kindle. In this book, Tiago shares valuable strategies on how to build a wonderful system from a vast digital knowledge. I immensely enjoyed the book, immediately grabbed the next one, and probably changed everything about my digital setup. And the best part: it's now easier than ever before.

## 7. [The PARA Method](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/134634583-the-para-method) by Tiago Forte

I highly recommend reading this book directly after Tiago's Second Brain book, as they complement each other perfectly. If you struggle with finding the perfect folder structure in your file setup, I can definitely recommend this book. It's much easier than you may think, as long as you follow a few simple techniques.
