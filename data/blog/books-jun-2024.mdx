_Marvin's Monthly Book Bites is a monthly newsletter I started in 2024 to share the books I've read over a month. [You can subscribe to updates here](https://world.hey.com/mrvn)._

Hey there üëã

While it is technically summer in Germany, you don't really feel it. In any case, this results in a lot of time for reading. And yes, I admit that I've been quite immersed in my Martin Suter bubble this month. But I think in the end, I found a book that pulled me out of it. This month, I read books. All of them were fiction.

## 1. [Allmen und die verschwundene Maria](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/19464323-allmen-und-die-verschwundene-mar-a) by Martin Suter

The fourth installment of Martin Suter‚Äôs series, ‚ÄúAllmen und die verschwundene Maria,‚Äù continues to deliver the comfort and enjoyment I‚Äôve come to love. This book is another delightful adventure with Allmen and Carlos, filled with intrigue and Suter‚Äôs signature charm.

The plot is engaging, and the characters are as captivating as ever. Suter masterfully balances suspense and wit, making it a perfect read for anyone looking for a well-crafted, entertaining crime novel.

For me, this series has become a comfort zone, providing endless fun and satisfaction. If you‚Äôre a fan of the series or just looking for an enjoyable escape, ‚ÄúAllmen und die verschwundene Maria‚Äù won‚Äôt disappoint.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. Another great addition to a fantastic series!

## 2. [Allmen und die Erotik](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40037332-allmen-und-die-erotik) by Martin Suter

"Allmen und die Erotik," the next addition to my collection of Martin Suter's beloved series, offers another engaging adventure with our favorite crime-solving duo, Allmen and Carlos. As always, Suter's elegant writing and well-crafted plot make for a delightful read.

This installment delves into the art world, mixing intrigue with a touch of sophistication. The story is captivating and keeps you hooked as Allmen navigates through another intricate mystery. However, the very open ending left me feeling a bit disappointed, as it didn't provide the closure I was hoping for.

Despite the ending, the book still offers plenty of enjoyment. The chemistry between Allmen and Carlos is as charming as ever, and their adventures continue to entertain. I'm looking forward to seeing where the series goes next and how the unresolved threads will be tied up.

Overall, I'd give "Allmen und die Erotik" 3 out of 5 stars. It's a good read that maintains the series' high standards, even if it leaves you wanting a bit more by the end.

## 3. [Allmen und der Koi](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49405325-allmen-und-der-koi) by Martin Suter

‚ÄúAllmen und der Koi,‚Äù the next installment in my beloved Martin Suter series, offers a refreshing change of scenery as it takes place on the sunny island of Ibiza. This new setting adds a delightful twist to the adventures of Allmen and Carlos, making it a perfect summer read.

The story is once again light and enjoyable, embodying the charm and sophistication we‚Äôve come to love from Suter‚Äôs writing. While it may not be incredibly suspenseful, it‚Äôs comfortably engaging and provides a nice escape. The relaxed pace and intriguing plot make it an ideal book to unwind with.

Overall, ‚ÄúAllmen und der Koi‚Äù is a great addition to the series. It‚Äôs not the most thrilling of Allmen‚Äôs adventures, but its easygoing nature and the vibrant Ibiza backdrop make it a delightful read.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. Perfect for a summer day, providing just the right mix of mystery and relaxation.

## 4. [Yellowface](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/62047984-yellowface) by Rebecca F. Kuang

I finally broke out of my Martin Suter bubble, and let me tell you, it was totally worth it! ‚ÄúYellowface‚Äù by R.F. Kuang was a refreshing change of pace. This book is so current and tackles a bunch of different themes in a really engaging way.

From the get-go, it was hard to put down. The story is gripping, the characters are well-developed, and the plot twists kept me hooked. It dives into issues of cultural appropriation, identity, and the cutthroat nature of the publishing industry, all while maintaining a sharp and witty narrative.

I was really happy with this read! It‚Äôs one of those books that keeps you thinking long after you‚Äôve turned the last page. If you‚Äôre looking for something fresh and relevant, ‚ÄúYellowface‚Äù is definitely worth picking up.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. A fantastic book that‚Äôs both thought-provoking and hard to put down.
