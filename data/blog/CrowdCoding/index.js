  **tl;dr** Thinking about live streaming code and work sessions on twitch to boost productivity and get more confident 💪

  I always find it quite fascinating how you get magically more productive when you manage to be accountable for something you create 🔥 That's why [#100DaysOfCode](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/posts/essays/100daysofcode) worked wonders for me or things like [gofuckingdoit.com](https://gofuckingdoit.com/) kick your ass 🙌 But the problem I've found... You can't maintain that level of accountability that easily with your side projects. BUT I've discovered some brilliant ideas from even more brilliant people. One of them: LIVE CODING 🎥
  
  You know those dudes who stream 20 straight hours on twitch, playing their favorite games and at the same time interacting with millions of people? 🤯 Why not doing this with coding 👨‍💻 I know, the concept is nothing new. But the concept is fascinating to me. And you immediately get several benefits that kick your productivity: 🚀
  
  **1) Accountability:** People are watching you, you can't check Reddit all the time. Damn, you want to show something! 👀
  
  **2) Leave your comfort zone:** I think at first this will be creepy and scary, but you only can win, gain and learn! 💪
  
  **3) Power of Crowd:** Pair programming is an amazing concept I think, now you have even more smart people! 🤓
  
  
  I won't promise things here, but chances are good that I will be live streaming some work in the next time. Maybe designs, writings or even coding projects! Or why not make a crowd project?! Well, ok things are escalating here. See you next time! 🙄😄
  
  Keep creating. Peace ✌️
