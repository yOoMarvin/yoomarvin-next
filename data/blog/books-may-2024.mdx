_Marvin's Monthly Book Bites is a monthly newsletter I started in 2024 to share the books I've read over a month. [You can subscribe to updates here](https://world.hey.com/mrvn)._

Hey there üëã

The month of May was probably not the month where I read the most books. Probably not my highlights of the year either, but I just find it so great that I have developed this little habit and now read much more regularly than a year ago. That's exactly what it's all about! The month was characterized by a few German books that have been on my list for a long time and a return to nonfiction. And now I have to say, I really feel like reading more nonfiction again. So if you have a recommendation for something I should definitely catch up on, let me know and just write me a message üòä

## 1. [The End of Loneliness](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28051948-vom-ende-der-einsamkeit) by Benedict Wells

Benedict Wells' "The End of Loneliness" is an impressive example of contemporary literature, combining a profound love story with a refreshing narrative style. Although love stories are not usually my preferred genre, Wells managed to capture my attention with his light and effortless writing style. The book is hard to put down and effortlessly draws the reader into the emotionally charged world of the main characters.

The story, spanning decades and following the fates of three siblings, is artfully woven with themes of loss, love, and the inevitable passage of time. Wells' ability to create deep and authentic characters adds a special depth to the novel.

Despite the quality of the storytelling and writing style, I personally could not fully identify with the love story, which may be due to my general preference for other genres. Therefore, I would give "The End of Loneliness" 3 out of 5 ‚≠ê. However, for readers who are drawn to a touching love story, this book is definitely worth recommending. Benedict Wells has created a great work that will surely capture many hearts.

## [South of the Border, West of the Sun](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17935268-s-dlich-der-grenze-westlich-der-sonne) by Haruki Murakami

aruki Murakami's "South of the Border, West of the Sun" is my first dip into his unique world, and I must say, his style is incredibly captivating and smooth. The writing is pleasant and engaging, making it easy to get lost in the story. It's definitely something different, a refreshing break from the norm.

The story itself has its gripping moments, pulling you in with an intriguing plot and complex characters. However, by the end, I found myself feeling somewhat unfulfilled. Maybe it's just a matter of personal taste, but the conclusion didn't quite hit the mark for me. That said, Murakami's storytelling has piqued my curiosity, and I'm eager to explore more of his work.

While this particular book didn't completely win me over, I can still appreciate the quality of Murakami's writing and the unique atmosphere he creates. I'll be diving into his other books for sure, hoping to find more stories that resonate with me.

Overall, I'd give "South of the Border, West of the Sun" 3 out of 5 ‚≠ê. It's worth a read, especially if you're looking for something different and enjoy a beautifully written narrative.

## 3. [Allmen und die Dahlien](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/17928401-allmen-und-die-dahlien) by Martin Suter

If you're on the hunt for something that entertains, thrills, and is superbly written, look no further than Martin Suter's "Allmen und die Dahlien." I've become a real fan of this series, and it's easy to see why. The crime-solving duo created by Suter is simply perfect for a good read.

This book, like the others in the series, keeps you hooked from start to finish. It's a classic whodunit, but with Suter's signature touch‚Äîelegant writing, well-crafted characters, and a plot that keeps you guessing. The chemistry between Allmen and Carlos adds an extra layer of enjoyment, making their adventures all the more engaging.

"Allmen und die Dahlien" is a testament to Suter's ability to blend suspense with a touch of sophistication. It's not just about solving the mystery; it's about enjoying the journey with these delightful characters. For anyone looking for a well-crafted, entertaining crime novel, this one hits the mark.

I'd give "Allmen und die Dahlien" 4 out of 5 ‚≠ê. It's a highly recommended read for fans of the genre and anyone who appreciates a well-told story.

## 4. [Slow Productivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/197773418-slow-productivity) by Cal Newport

As a long-time fan of Cal Newport, I‚Äôve probably read all his books, and his latest, ‚ÄúSlow Productivity,‚Äù didn‚Äôt disappoint. This book is incredibly timely and resonates deeply with me. Newport has a knack for addressing current issues, and this one hits the nail on the head.

The core message of ‚ÄúSlow Productivity‚Äù is clear and compelling: we need to slow down to be more effective and fulfilled. Newport‚Äôs argument is backed by numerous examples that vividly illustrate his points. It‚Äôs refreshing to see a book that challenges the hustle culture and advocates for a more mindful approach to work.

However, I felt that ‚ÄúSlow Productivity‚Äù fell a bit short in providing practical implementation tips. While the philosophy is solid, the book could have benefitted from more actionable advice. Without these, it remains more of an inspiring idea than a practical guide.

Despite this, the book is still a great read and a valuable addition to Newport‚Äôs body of work. It‚Äôs thought-provoking and encourages a necessary shift in how we approach productivity.

I‚Äôd give ‚ÄúSlow Productivity‚Äù 3 out of 5 ‚≠ê. It‚Äôs definitely worth reading, especially if you‚Äôre looking to rethink your approach to work and embrace a slower, more deliberate pace.
