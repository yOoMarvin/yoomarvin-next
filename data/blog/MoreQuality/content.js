Today's post isn't about big glorious content and you won't learn something here. It's rather a short message because I want to change the things here a bit. 
I'm doing this blogging thing for a while now and it's time to draw a little conclusion. How are things going so far? What will I be doing with this thing in the future? And what are my expectations and goals? Let's grab the reading glasses and dive deeper into the world of my blog. 

### The Start
I've written the very first blog post here in [April 2017](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/coding/2017/04/30/100DaysOfCode.html). Well, actually that wasn't the real first post. It was just a little article I've published first on my [Medium Page](https://medium.com/@yOoMarvin). After the first big redesign of my site in July 2017, I've decided to start a regular blog. My ambitions weren't that spectacular and I was completely new to writing! So the first goal was to do 1 blog post every 2 weeks. And that went pretty well so far. I've stuck to that and I'm now having some really cool posts on several topics around coding, design, productivity, and learning. But I'm now at a point where I want to do something different. The first part was actually just getting to know the writing part and trying things out. Building a routine and sticking to deadlines. I've really enjoyed that, but now I'm wanting to move and doing the next step.

### The Future
The main problem I've discovered over the past few weeks is the quality of the posts. Sure, there are some pretty interesting topics, but there isn't a real common theme here. Blogging besides my Master's Program, work, hobbies and coding projects isn't the easiest thing and I caught myself sometimes on Sunday with nothing prepared for the post. So it was some kind of 'Ah, just get something out' feeling. And that isn't the thing I'm wanting to do. 

That's why I've decided to **stop the bi-weekly blog posts**. That does not mean that there won't be any blog posts in the future. Of course not! But what I'm going to do here is **trading quantity for quality**. I just want to write posts where I'm personally learning something. A post that brings value to other people, but also brings value to me. And a post that I'm happy with. I think that's a good thing. I have so many great ideas for blog posts and I can't even wait to start working on them more intensivly.

The other thing is: **updates**. Yes. Recently I'm trying some things out on my [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yoomarvin/) account. I'm using this as a little mini blog platform where I will put out 1-2 posts per week with little updates. I also like the story feature where I can give little updates on the day. The only problem on Instagram for me: Visuals. I just don't want to take cool looking photos but at the same time I know: Visuals are king on Instagram. I'm trying to find a balance now but maybe I will also do a little shift. I'm also thinking about doing those little 'updates' on a second category on my blog. Naming this 'Journal' or something like that. The structure will actually be the same as a big blog post or essay but it will be a lot shorter and more minimalistic. So I can concentrate on the writing part, but at the same time I'm putting out content. I've also thought about doing those little updates in a newsletter but I just think it wouldn't be that interesting for people to read. There isn't much value in those little journal posts. But I will keep this newsletter thing in the back of my head. Maybe I will use it in the future. 

### The Goals, The Topics
As I've started this blog I said it's all about _coding, design, life, and work_. Well, actually that could be everything and for me, a real topic is missing. Some recurring theme or a purpose is what I'm looking for. With my young age and my rather short professional experience, I'm not in a 'Guru position' where I can shoot out wisdom like the big guys. **But what I can tell you about, is my journey**. All the things I'm learning at university, at my job, and at my side projects. All the experiences I'm making and all the things I'm trying out. And this is actually what I'm wanting to do in the next years: **Learning**. I don't want to build a giant audience explicitly. I just want to get to know interesting topics and people and speak with them about my experiences. Those are my goals and the things I want to talk about. Because of my educational background, this will, of course, remain in the digital world around code and design, mainly. But some forays in other worlds are not excluded. 

### The new course
The new course is set and I'm very excited how things are going to develop in the future. First of all, I'm going to finish my redesign of my site where I keep the new shift in my mind. Things are happening.
If you are one of my few regular readers. Thank you. I appreciate it from the bottom of my heart. Feel free to contact me! I would love to hear from you.

Until then. Thank you. Keep creating. Peace. `;
