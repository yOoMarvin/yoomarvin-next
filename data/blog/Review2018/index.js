  **tl;dr** 2018 taught me many great things and I’ve learned a ton of stuff. Now it’s time to reflect and set goals for 2019!

Humans! It’s that time of the year again… Christmas is over and the last days of the year are passing by ⏱. So, naturally, it is time to reflect a bit and set goals for the next year. So what has happened in my world in 2018? Short answer: A TON! 🚀 I’ve written [47 blog posts](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/journal) with so much different content. I’ve re-read all of them and I can see how I have developed myself over the last year and how the picture of my future is getting clearer. 🤓

The year started with the decision to do this little journal entries and mini blog posts, which was a brilliant idea! Writing long format text is not my thing and I rather want to push out short little updates of the stuff I’m doing. And one thing for sure: I will 100% continue this format and even try to write more here! 🙏 Afterward, I’ve redesigned my site from the ground up to focus more on the new format and it still looks great (which is actually a wonder 😂 ). Additionally, I’ve visited beautiful and cold Finnland 🇫🇮 3 times in the first half of the year and had an amazing and wonderful time there!

The next big thing I’ve started this year was [100 Days Of Reading](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/posts/journal/100DaysOfReading) 📚. And boy, I did it! I’ve finished that in June and read 6 books, which is crazy for me! Honestly, I was never a reading person, but that challenge totally changed my perspective! It has thought me a lot about habit building and I’m still reading now on a daily basis.
In May, a lot has changed for me and I did something I wanted to do for so long. [I’ve started a podcast](https://anchor.fm/beruehrpunkt) 🎧. Actually, I’ve started 2 podcasts at the same time, but that’s another story. My little baby is called ‚Berührpunkt‘ and it’s a german podcast about my world and the stuff I’m learning as a digital pioneer, developer, and designer. I’ve changed the structure several times now and today I have a format I’m really loving! Short little links and news, things from the design world, coding thoughts and stuff I’m loving. Every Friday morning that is a great ritual to push something out in the world. And it teaches me so many great things! 🚀
In September I’ve also decided to start [design explorations](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/explorations) of my favorite apps and products. Okay, by now it’s only one exploration. But one of my goals for 2019 is definitely to do more here! 💪
Two highlights of the year were also the 2 hackathons I went to. Meeting awesome people, hack through the night and learn a ton of stuff. 👨‍💻 That actually describes the whole year pretty well! 
On the other side, I also did a lot of sports and enjoyed time outside. Several 10 k races and new personal records. But 2019 is already waiting! 
And boy, I can’t decide where to stop here. 2018 has taught me so many great things: DesignThinking, more coding, designing, trello, productivity, minimalism, the hook model, plant-based diet,  psychology of design and SO MANY MORE STUFF! 😱

But what will 2019 bring? Well, I have some goals and I really want to improve myself in several aspects. So here is a short list of the 5 most important things! 🔥

1. Write at least 30 blog posts and 10 Design Explorations. Try to unite the podcast and the blog more!
2. Code more! Ship at least one product!
3. Get those miles! Do a half marathon in May and at least one triathlon in summer!
4. Keep living healthy and improving my plant-based diet!
5. Read at least one book per month!
6. Live more minimal and get rid of stuff you don’t need.

That’s it. 2018 was pretty tough but overall a great year of development. But 2019 will be getting bigger. 🔥

Keep Improving, keep Developing, keep Creating ✌️
