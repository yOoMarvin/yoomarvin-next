  **tl;dr** Voice is an amazing new form of interaction! Learn as much as you can and build thing!!! 

Quite some time ago I got myself a cute little Amazon Echo device 🗣. You know? The weird black, bottle formed thing that many people find creepy because it _listens_ to you all the time?🔍 The very polite lady inside is quite handy when it comes to little tasks and information you want to consume👍 Today I’m using it mainly for smart home controls, news, little information, music and handy tools like timers and stuff. And you know what? I fucking love this thing! 😍 Of course, I’m a bit nerdy here and checked out the developer documentation from top to bottom. Already developed some nice skills, 🤓 for private use and at work (also one at the [**INNOHACKS**](http://marvinmessenzehl.com/posts/essays/innohacks) hackathon). Additionally, to my Amazon Echo, I got myself a Google Home mini and I’m comparing the two assistants now side by side which is quite interesting. 

BUT, what I wanted to say actually is: **VOICE IS A BIG THING!** And it sells you one main asset: **TIME** ⏰ I think this form of interaction will definitely develop and grow in the future. It just feels so natural and effortless. And just think about how young the ecosystem is. I know, the killer app like maybe an Instagram for the phone wasn’t published yet. But hey, the ecosystem is fucking **YOUNG!** What now? Grab your favorite coder buddy, dive into the world of voice interaction and start to create **THAT KILLER APP!** I love to observe those amazing trends and I want to try out as much as possible! Learning as much as possible 🚀


Keep creating. Peace ✌️
