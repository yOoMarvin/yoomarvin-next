  **tl;dr** Never been out more in the summer. Explore, test your limits and grow. That’s running

This summer is really fascinating. Besides learning a ton of new stuff I really find one thing amazing. Being outside. Nothing beats the feeling of waking up early, put on your running shoes and just go out there. Silence, refreshing winds, and light touches of the first sun rays. I never was an endurance person. And if you would have told me 4 years ago that I’m going to run an easy 15K in the morning I would ask in which reality you are living. But somehow this changed. I don’t know why and I don’t know what exactly the push was, but at one morning I just went for a little run. And then another, and another. Then there was the first injury, but somehow I was hooked on running. On going out there and reaching limits. So I came back and ran again. Sure I have goals, sure I want to get better. But there are also those days where I’m just going out and start cruising. Not thinking about where to go and what’s next. Not thinking about my training program. Just listen to the body and go. Go on. That’s the thing I do. Those are my thoughts On Running. 

Keep on running ✌️🏃‍♂️
