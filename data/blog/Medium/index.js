  **tl;dr** I’m now also putting every single post on Medium!

INSERT COOL SOUND! 🎧 Want to know what one of the few apps on my home screen is? 📱 Medium. I just love this app and the community behind it. It is a brilliant way to write things and to reach a big audience. I’m a long time reader there and dig a lot of stuff ❤️ I’ve also published some of my first articles on Medium and I can say you. You instantly reach a lot of people. But now I was asking myself. Dude? Why don’t you post on Medium anymore? And I have no freaking clue! 😱 Medium is genius! That’s why I’m now pushing every single post on [Medium](https://medium.com/@yOoMarvin), too. One content, many platforms! 🚀 

Keep Creating✌️
