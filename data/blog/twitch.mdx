🎬 🤯 My first experiences on Twitch were... wild.

🧙 For a few weeks now, I have been streaming occasionally on Twitch. Nothing special, just relaxed co-working sessions using the Pomodoro Technique. 25 (or sometimes 45) minutes of focused work and 5 minutes of break. Sometimes in the evenings, I dive straight into Figma files for side projects.

👀 I would say that I have gotten used to speaking to a camera, thanks to Zoom & Loom. But Twitch is something completely different. Here are my top 3 learnings from the first few times on-air:

1️⃣ Recording a video is completely different from being live. I was incredibly nervous and didn't really have a plan at the beginning on what and how to do it. But practice makes perfect, and I already feel much more comfortable now.

2️⃣ Twitch and the whole streaming landscape (yes, OBS, I'm talking about you) are incredibly technological and not very user-friendly. Overlays, widgets, plugins, bitrates. There is so much to learn. I probably don't even know 1% of the things one should know, but I just love diving into something and learning along the way.

3️⃣ The co-working stream is incredibly beneficial for me, and I rarely have entered a flow state so easily. It's incredibly fun, and one is incredibly accountable.
