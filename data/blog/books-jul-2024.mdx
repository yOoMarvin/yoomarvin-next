Hey there üëã

Who would have thought, but we are changing a little bit in our reading habits. Okay, you caught me. I did read a Martin Suter book this month, but only because it smiled at me in my local library! I have switched back to Sci-Fi, was absolutely thrilled, and currently listen to more audiobooks than podcasts. That's something. This time, unfortunately, I don't have a picture with the beautiful book covers because I have already returned everything, but I will try to make one again next month! Let's go!

## 1. [Allmen und Herr Weynfeldt](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201149208-allmen-und-herr-weynfeldt) by Martin Suter

Yes, I admit it. I have once again entered my Martin Suter bubble. More so in the Allmen bubble. But it's just so enjoyable to read. And that's what it's all about in the end. When I found the latest Allmen installment at my local library, I just had to take a peek. I'll be honest. The first 100 pages didn't excite me and almost bored me, but with the murder and the many suspects, a tension built up that not all Allmen books have.

I hope that wasn't the last installment of the series. For me, it's always a pleasure to immerse myself in this world again. I would give this very Allmen like book 4 out of 5 stars.

## 2. [Elon Musk](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/122765395-elon-musk) by Walter Isaacson

Listening to the audiobook of Walter Isaacson‚Äôs ‚ÄúElon Musk‚Äù was quite the experience. Isaacson is known for his incredibly detailed biographies, and this one is no exception. By the end, you feel like you really get to know the person behind the name.

Elon Musk is undoubtedly a fascinating character. The book dives deep into his life, exploring both his extraordinary achievements and his more controversial actions. Isaacson doesn‚Äôt shy away from the complexities of Musk‚Äôs personality, giving a balanced view that highlights his genius as well as his flaws.

What I love about Isaacson‚Äôs biographies is how thorough they are. You come away with a sense of understanding, even if you don‚Äôt agree with everything the subject does. Musk‚Äôs story is a wild ride of innovation, ambition, and controversy, and Isaacson captures it all brilliantly.

Overall, this is a must-read (or must-listen) for anyone interested in the life of one of the most influential figures of our time. It‚Äôs detailed, engaging, and gives you plenty to think about.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. A captivating biography that truly brings Elon Musk to life.

## 3. [The Three Body Problem](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20518872-the-three-body-problem) by Cixin Liu

‚ÄúAllmen und der Koi,‚Äù the next installment in my beloved Martin Suter series, offers a refreshing change of scenery as it takes place on the sunny island of Ibiza. This new setting adds a delightful twist to the adventures of Allmen and Carlos, making it a perfect summer read.

The story is once again light and enjoyable, embodying the charm and sophistication we‚Äôve come to love from Suter‚Äôs writing. While it may not be incredibly suspenseful, it‚Äôs comfortably engaging and provides a nice escape. The relaxed pace and intriguing plot make it an ideal book to unwind with.

Overall, ‚ÄúAllmen und der Koi‚Äù is a great addition to the series. It‚Äôs not the most thrilling of Allmen‚Äôs adventures, but its easygoing nature and the vibrant Ibiza backdrop make it a delightful read.

I‚Äôd give it 4 out of 5 stars. Perfect for a summer day, providing just the right mix of mystery and relaxation.
