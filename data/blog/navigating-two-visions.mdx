In the realm of technology, we are currently witnessing the emergence of two distinct visions that promise to redefine our interaction with the digital world. The most interesting thing for me is that these two visions of the future seem like the exact opposite from each other. One is pure UI, while the other one has no UI at all. Clearly, I'm speaking of [visionOS](https://www.apple.com/apple-vision-pro/) and [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt), and in the past few days, I found myself thinking more and more about the philosophical, technical, and practical implications of each approach.

## No UI

ChatGPT represents a vision of technology that prioritizes simplicity and accessibility. It embodies the idea of minimizing the user interface (UI), aiming to make technology as unobtrusive as possible. In this vision, the essence of interaction is conversationâ€”a natural and intuitive form of communication that requires no learning curve.

Just imagining it: "A natural interaction with technology" makes you feel like you're in a sci-fi movie. And something about this idea triggers something in you. We've been in this hype before, which quickly dissipated (also because the technology wasn't there yet). Back then, it was with Alexa, Google Home, Siri, and the like. But let's be honest. [Until today, most "smart" assistants have been disappointing](https://www.theverge.com/22704233/siri-apple-digital-assistant-10-years-development-problems-why).

ChatGPT was the first moment for me where I thought, "Wow, this actually feels natural." ChatGPT is not just a tool; it's an assistant that fades into the background, ready to serve with a simple prompt. This approach advocates for a future where technology adapts to human needs, rather than imposing new modes of interaction. It is a vision that seeks to streamline our digital experiences, making them more efficient and less intrusive.

I always think of it like in the movie "[Her](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1798709/?language=de-de)" (that I really, really like), and I see that this vision might come closer and closer.

## Pure UI

On the other side of the spectrum, we have VisionOS. VisionOS offers a vision that embraces UI, integrating it into every aspect of our visual field. This approach is not about simplification; it's about augmentation. VisionOS imagines a future where digital information overlays our physical environment, transforming the way we perceive and interact with the world. This vision is immersive and visually intensive, requiring users to adapt to new forms of interaction. It represents a bold reimagining of our relationship with technology, one that places the digital experience front and center. Now that we have [the first reviews coming in](https://www.theverge.com/24054862/apple-vision-pro-review-vr-ar-headset-features-price) and seeing this technology more and more in our everyday life (at least for some people), we see that the technology might not be 100% there yet, but I believe the current and first VisionPro gives us a little sneak peek. It's a little window through which we can see how this concept might look like in the future. In the end, VisionOS challenges us to embrace a more interactive and enriched environment, pushing the boundaries of what is possible with augmented and virtual reality.

## What will change?

These contrasting visions are not just technological innovations; they are philosophical statements about the future of human-computer interaction. ChatGPT's minimalist approach suggests a future where technology serves quietly, enhancing our lives without demanding attention. It speaks to a desire for efficiency and a seamless integration of digital assistance into our daily routines. On the other hand, VisionOS's immersive approach envisions a more dynamic and engaging relationship with technology, one that enriches our sensory experiences and expands the possibilities of interaction. Personally, I can't even say which one I would prefer more. I can't predict which vision will prevail or how the future will change. But speaking from my digital design perspective, all of this is very interesting.

Speaking from this practical standpoint, these visions also have significant implications for how we design and interact with technology. ChatGPT's approach suggests a future where simplicity and ease of use are paramount, where the challenge lies in creating AI that can understand and anticipate human needs. Conversely, VisionOS requires a rethinking of UI design, where the challenge is to create immersive and intuitive augmented experiences that enhance, rather than distract from, the physical world.

## Bringing it all together

As we navigate these contrasting visions of the future, we are challenged to consider not only the technological possibilities they present but also the kind of digital world we wish to inhabit. Both ChatGPT and VisionOS are extraordinary in their potential to reshape our relationship with technology. By examining these visions, we gain insight into the evolving landscape of human-computer interaction and the choices that will shape our digital future. As we stand at this crossroads, the question remains: How will we balance simplicity and immersion, efficiency and engagement as we move forward into this uncharted territory?
