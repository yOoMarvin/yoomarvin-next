So, I was a bit absent from my Instagram, but it's the new year now and I'm fully back! Let's try something in the next time here! Doing little posts about code ðŸ–¥, design ðŸŽ¨, work, life, and sports here. Not with 100% focus on the visuals but rather on the text. So make sure you read all the thing ðŸ““. More in-depth posts will be published in my digital home and blog. 
I'm excited about the new year. I have some projects in my head, but important things first: Redesigning my website. Today I've finished the design and concept, now rewriting this whole thing and I have no Idea where to start ðŸ¤¯. But don't panic. Keep calm and start with small things first. Let's do this! ðŸ’ª
