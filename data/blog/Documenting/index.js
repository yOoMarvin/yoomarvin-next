  **tl;dr** I don’t want to plan the perfect content. Rather I want to start things, and talk about the process!

  Documenting over creating. That tagline fascinates me quite some time now. And you know what? I’ve struggled a reaaaaally long time 🤦‍♂️. But with what? Well… STARTING! All the time I thought about how to put out some content and about what exactly to talk and how to polish things. I looked up gears and tools and wrote long lists with requirements and bla bla bla… Dude… I fucking procrastinated 🤯! But why? Because I worried too much? WAY TOO MUCH! If you want to put out something in the world, go and fucking do it! 🚀 Don’t think about the aspect of creation. Document your journey in mastering a skill. Document your journey in learning new stuff. And let that be your content! ✍️
  
  And that’s exactly what I’m trying to do now. Documenting my journey in digital product design, coding, triathlon and a lot of stuff that’s in my brain. And I’m doing this by writing those little posts here 📝 and talking into an old microphone in my podcast 🎧. I would love to take you with me on my journey. LET’S DO THIS! 💪
  
  Keep Creating✌️
  
  Oh btw. my podcast has a new name. It's called _Berührpunkt_ now. You can find it on [Anchor](https://anchor.fm/beruehrpunkt) and any other podcasting platform.
