_Marvin's Monthly Book Bites is a monthly newsletter I started in 2024 to share the books I've read over a month. [You can subscribe to updates here](https://world.hey.com/mrvn)._

Hey there üëã

I'm being completely honest; it was a strange month in terms of reading, and I thought long and hard about whether I should write this edition of the newsletter. But since I am just a creature of habit, I had to do it.

And I'll let the cat out of the bag right away: I didn't read any books this month. I still have "The Hotel New Hampshire" by John Irving on my desk, and the new Stephen King book "You Like It Darker" is also waiting on my nightstand to be finished. Of course, I was still reading, but it was something completely different from what I've done so far this year.

## 1. [One Piece Arabasta Saga](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/Arabasta_Saga) (Vol. 12-24) by Eiichiro Oda

The main part of my reading this month has been One Piece. I read the 2nd saga, the Arabasta Arc, and I was completely immersed. I never thought that mangas could fascinate me so much. Maybe it's the One Piece story itself, but right now, one of my favorite rituals is to sit in my chair after work and continue advancing in the story.

Now I'm already in the middle of the next saga, the Sky Island Saga, and from here on, I have to admit that I‚Äôm completely lost when it comes to the One Piece story. The more I look forward to it. Next month, there will be another big update!

If you have any manga recommendations, please let me know!
