Hey there üëã

April was definitely one of those months where reading was difficult for me. A lot of things happened around me and it was hard to consciously find time for reading. But whenever I sat down with a book, I enjoyed it. I learned that there is almost no other activity that helps me relax as well as reading. This month, I managed to read a total of 5 books. Let's take a look.

## 1. [The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/51497.The_Strange_Case_of_Dr_Jekyll_and_Mr_Hyde_and_Other_Tales_of_Terror) by Robert Louis Stevenson

"Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde" is a thrilling dive into the duality of human nature, where a respected scientist unleashes his darker side through a mysterious potion. It's a classic that feels surprisingly modern, tackling themes of identity, morality, and the inner battles we all face. What makes it worth picking up is not just the suspenseful plot but also its profound insights into the human psyche. It's a short read that packs a punch, leaving you pondering long after you've turned the last page. Perfect for anyone who loves a story that combines psychological depth with edge-of-your-seat excitement. I would rate this book with 4/5 ‚≠ê.

## 2.[ The Power Broker: Robert Moses and the Fall of New York](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1111.The_Power_Broker) by Robert A. Caro

The Power Broker by Robert Caro is a deep dive into Robert Moses' world, the guy who pretty much sculpted New York into what it is today. Caro pulls you through the epic tale of Moses‚Äô rise to power, his genius in building bridges, parks, and highways, and how he bulldozed (sometimes literally) through opposition. It's a massive read that's as fascinating as it is hefty, showing both the brilliant and dark sides of wielding so much power. Finishing this book feels like a marathon, but it's totally worth it for the stunning view it offers into how New York was built. Plus, Caro has a way with ending chapters that just makes you go, 'Wow, did he really just say that?' It makes you want to hop on the next plane to New York to see Moses' handiwork in person. I would rate this book with very nerdy 5/5 ‚≠ê

## 3. [Misery](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10614.Misery) by Stephen King

When you think of Stephen King, you inevitably think of his knack for gripping and scaring us with his stories. "Misery" is a quintessential example, a true gem from his heyday. In this book, King limits the setting to a few locations and characters, which makes the tension even more intense. Admittedly, the first third of the book feels a bit stretched, likely due to the careful laying of the groundwork for the story. This quieter phase allows for a deep exploration of the intense relationship between the author and his "number one fan," Annie Wilkes. But not to worry, the last 100 pages make up for any earlier pacing issues by rewarding readers with an emotional rollercoaster and relentless suspense. Once again, King masters the art of creating an atmosphere that sends shivers down your spine. "Misery" is thus a must-read for fans of classic, gripping horror. I would rate this book 4/5 ‚≠ê

## 4. [Allmen und der rosa Diamant](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11962303-allmen-und-der-rosa-diamant) by Martin Suter

Martin Suter once again takes us into the fascinating world of Johann Friedrich von Allmen, a charming gentleman with a taste for art and luxury. "Allmen and the Pink Diamond" is the second book in the series and offers an elegant glimpse into the life of this unconventional hero. Although the book may not be outstanding, it remains consistently enjoyable. Fans of Allmen's world will delight in gliding through the pages, enveloped in the stylish atmosphere and refined language that Suter masterfully employs.

While the suspense may be limited, Suter knows how to surprise and captivate readers with unexpected twists. The pink diamond itself adds an exotic touch that stirs curiosity and sets the stage for Allmen's adventure. Although the crime case may not be the most complex, it is the characters and the world that Suter creates that make this book so enjoyable.

I will definitely be reading part 3 as well.
I would rate this book with 4/5 ‚≠ê

## 5. [The Alchemist](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18144590-the-alchemist) by Paolo Coelho

"The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho is a tale woven with the themes of destiny and personal quest, acclaimed for its profound life lessons and spiritual wisdom. At its core, it is an inspiring story that encourages readers to pursue their dreams and listen to their hearts, a message that resonates deeply with many. This novel tells the journey of Santiago, a young shepherd who travels from his home in Spain to the deserts of Egypt in search of treasure, only to discover a more profound personal treasure within.

However, despite its original intentions and positive insights, "The Alchemist" has faced some backlash in recent years. The over-saturation of its recommendations and the misappropriation of its themes into toxic business ideologies have somewhat tainted its original message. These issues are hard to ignore and have made the book's wisdom feel less genuine, as if the profound messages have been co-opted for less noble pursuits.

While the story itself remains beautiful and full of valuable insights for life, the external factors surrounding its reception and misuse cannot be overlooked. Therefore, I would rate "The Alchemist" 3 out of 5 ‚≠ê. It still holds value for those seeking inspiration and a push towards self-discovery, but it's wise to approach it with an awareness of the context in which it has been framed in recent discussions.
