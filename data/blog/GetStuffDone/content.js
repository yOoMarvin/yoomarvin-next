I think I’ve finally found the key 🔑 to productivity. Well maybe not that one key to rule them all, but definitely one of the many keys! And it sounds tremendously simple. IF IT TAKES LESS THEN 1 MINUTE. DO IT NOW! 🙌 This is called „The 1-minute rule“. Of course, you can extend that to every number you want, but let’s start simple. If a new todo item comes up in my head🧠 I just ask myself: Hey, will this take more than 1 minute? 🤔 If no… kill it! Feels great to smash that todo list down and focus on the more complex goals of the day. Get stuff done and keep creating. Peace ✌️
