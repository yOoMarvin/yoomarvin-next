  **tl;dr** A long month in the home office, with good productivity and the end of a great freelance project. Oh, and I've read one of the greatest fiction books ever!

Nobody was really in the mood for April fools this month. But let's get over it. We must accept it as it is and make the best out of it. As the stoics always say: You can't control what happens, but you can control how you react to it. For me, it was a whole month in the home office. Actually my first month I've been working fully remote every but I think that's the same for most of the German and European folks out there. Besides staying at home, this month still had some surprises and cool things. So let's get into the review of month numero 4 of 2020!

### Results & Insights

First of all: books. What has happened to the world of books this month? I've broken my routine, laid the fiction books aside, and got myself lost in an all-time classic: [Dune](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/234225.Dune?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=a2OKmtXwtt&rank=1) by Frank Herbert. Damn, that one is a diamond. If you're just a tiny little bit interested in science fiction, grab it, got yourself some cookies and a blanket go for it. I've never experienced such a brilliant world and such unique storytelling. And boy am I hyped for the upcoming movie this year. The cast and the [first shots of some scenes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1EI-UrAweXE) look amazing!

In the world of work, I'm super proud of the results of the past month. Besides working efficiently from home I've finished my first ever freelancing project with a whole logo and branding concept for a young startup. The work was pretty hard and I really got in the details but honestly: It was so much worth it. I've learned so many cool things and really leveled up my design and communication skills. I don't know if I will do such big projects again in the future, besides work. And I think I really want to get into coding more again. I've also got some pretty cool ideas for new side projects... the ongoing problem is starting them. I don't know why but when it comes to side projects I'm so much trapped inside my comfort zone. Although I know all the benefits of side projects and the great opportunities it provides when it comes to learning something new I'm not able to get myself up and start working on one. Okay, right now there are a lot of other things in my mind, but the whole side project topic is definitely one I want to attack more in the future.

Good news: I finally went back to the pomodoro technique. I've written a lot about this in the past and we were in an ongoing on-off relationship. Recently I said to myself: "Hey, why don't you try working with pomodoros today?" And boy, the productivity went out of the roof. I've found myself being easier distractible at home, so working really focused for short periods (25 minutes or less) is really efficient for me. The distractions decreased and the productivity, output, and level of contentment increased. Win-win here. Now I just have to stick to it!

One thing I'm totally digging right now is the thought of linked notes systems. I've come across the notes of [Andy Matuschak](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/). It's kind of based on the Zettelkasten system by Luhmann and links notes in graph way. The really cool thing for me: You don't have a detailed overview or list of contents. That means you click on a note and your journey starts. But be careful: you can get lost here. It's the same phenomenon when you click on a youtube video about front end development and find yourself watching tutorials about making candles a few hours later. But all in all, I think it's super interesting! I've not found a good implemented system or software solution out there, so if you have one, get in touch with me! Maybe this one is also one for the side projects!

Last thing this month: I'm addicted to bike riding. No joke. I've made my first 100K ride outside (of course alone) and experienced some crazy cool adventures over the weekends. That also led to [ordering a new gravel bike](https://www.canyon.com/de-de/road-bikes/gravel-bikes/grail/). Almost 1000K of riding this month and I hope this number will grow in the next months! Being out there, getting disconnected and just experience nature is such an awesome feeling and gives so much energy back. Really. Get out in nature more.

### What's up for next month?

Okay, so let's take a look at what's next! Actually, May is one of my favorite months. Okay, let's be honest... It's also my birthday month, but that's another story. Typically the weather gets nicer and nicer and it's time for getting outside and riding the bike for hours. This month I'm also having some days off and time to relax. Maybe I will pick up a new game. Or maybe... I finally should start a new side project. But let's see how things will develop. There are still a lot of things in my mind right now and in addition to that, I'm moving in a few months. So that's a whole other level of side projects. Oh, and of course I'm starting a new book to read. It's [Company of One by Paul Jarvis](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/37570605-company-of-one?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=yzNLsU9tgi&rank=1). I'm again super excited about this one since I've gotten it recommended soooo much! All in all, some days off, getting out and hopefully reading a lot. Have a great month and make the best out of the current situation!

Keep Creating ✌️
