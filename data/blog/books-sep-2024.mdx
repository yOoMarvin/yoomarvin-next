Hey there üëã

What a month it has been! I bought new books, ran my first marathon, read less, flew to Japan, discovered mangas, and then read a lot again. It‚Äôs been quite a rollercoaster. Even though I didn‚Äôt read an overwhelming number of books, let‚Äôs do a little review. In total, I read 2 fiction books, 1 nonfiction book, and a bunch of manga volumes! If I include the mangas, I‚Äôm now at 55 books this year ü§©

## 1. [Views](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/210822100-views) by Marc-Uwe Kling

First of all, I have to say that I have known Marc-Uwe Kling only from the two parts of Qualityland, which I found truly fantastic. In contrast, Views never really grabbed me. The characters seemed too flat to me, the dialogues too scripted, and the key moments predictable. The ending felt too quick and abrupt to me. However, I am probably not the target audience for this book.

## 2. [Feel Good Productivity](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/142402923-feel-good-productivity) by Ali Abdaal

I have been following Ali for a long time and was really looking forward to the book. I believe I have learned more about productivity from him than from any other YouTuber, and I have discovered and tried many things thanks to him. Feel-Good Productivity has an incredibly good introduction. I think I liked the first part about the energizers the most, and I took away the most from it. Simply because it was different and stood out from what I had experienced before. However, I quickly fell back into old patterns, and there wasn't much new for me. Just based on the introduction, I can already recommend the book.

## 3. [M√∂chte die Witwe angesprochen werden, platziert sie auf dem Grab die Gie√ükanne mit dem Ausguss nach vorne](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/201467483-m-chte-die-witwe-angesprochen-werden-platziert-sie-auf-dem-grab-die-gie) by Sasa Stanisic

Sa≈°a Stani≈°iƒá's new work was on everyone's lips and praised so often by critics in the German literary scene that I had to read it. I must say, it wasn't quite my cup of tea. In the end, it's a collection of different stories, some of which I found brilliant, while I couldn't connect with others at all. But I suppose that's the nature of story collections.

What is definitely noteworthy is the language and the emotion behind each individual text. It is certainly thought-provoking and inspiring, but not to my taste. A strange review, I know.

## 4. [One Piece East Blue Saga](https://onepiece.fandom.com/wiki/East_Blue_Saga) (Vol. 1-12) by Eiichiro Oda

I used to love One Piece so much. As I got older, I somehow lost my connection to it. But it came rushing back when I was in Japan. I couldn't believe how many people were reading manga on the train, while waiting, or on their way to work. I became more interested and quickly found myself back into One Piece. I'm now reading the volumes digitally through the Books app on my iPhone and iPad, and I'm completely immersed again. I almost know the East Blue Saga by heart, but diving back in was so much fun that I didn't care at all. Now I'm continuing, and I think my memories will be a bit hazy starting from volume 30. I'm even more excited for that!

If you have any manga recommendations, please let me know!
