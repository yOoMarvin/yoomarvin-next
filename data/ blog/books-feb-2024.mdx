Hey there üëã

This year, February is once again a bit longer. The days are also getting longer. This makes me extremely happy, as the long, dark winter months have slowly taken a toll on my mood. While I have savored every single ray of sunshine this month, I have also read a lot. Many of the books I mention here are in German, and I am not sure if there is already a translation available for all of them. But that should not stop us from reading great books! In February, I read 5 books, all of them in paperback format. Let's get into it.

## 1. [The Parfume](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2896.Das_Parfum_Die_Geschichte_eines_M_rders) by Patrick S√ºsskind

I had only heard of the film before. But "The Perfume" was definitely familiar to me. After just a few pages, I already had the feeling that this book was a page turner. Right from the beginning, the first pages of Jean-Baptiste Grenouille's life are so interestingly written that you just want to keep reading. The rest goes by in the blink of an eye. It's safe to say that this book immerses you in a world full of scents. I stopped several times, closed my eyes, and simply let the book and its descriptions wash over me. It's an incredible story of scents and murders.

## 2. [Siddartha](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52036.Siddhartha) by Hermann Hesse

I believe there are few books that would be so difficult for me to write about and form an opinion on. And at the same time, a book has probably fascinated me so much on so few pages. Siddhartha describes the journey of the protagonist of the same name on his path to enlightenment. The book is in itself a small journey. A timeless classic, which is not easy to read, but incredibly resonates. Personally, it had an incredible impact on me and should be read in all schools.

## 3. [Allmen and the dragonflies](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9651474-allmen-und-die-libellen) by Martin Suter

I am slowly but surely starting to believe that Martin Suter could become one of my favorite authors. 'Allem und die Libellen' was once again one of those books that just flew by and created a wonderful world. A world in which one can navigate and find oneself easily. Martin Suter has a unique talent for building up conflicts and tensions, only to solve them with intelligence in a sudden and satisfying way. If each of the 7 parts of 'Allmen' is as entertaining, I am already looking forward to the second part!

## 4. [Montecristo](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23900031-montecristo) by Martin Suter

Yes, looking at this month, it seems like I have entered the Martin Suter Rabbit Hole. But I like it. He is currently one of my favorite authors and I am slowly getting used to his style. However, Montecristo was definitely different. It almost feels like a thriller. But the most exciting thing for me is how the (partly predictable) story builds up over 300 pages from two completely different events and gradually comes together. I believe this was also what made it difficult for me to put the book down.

## 5. [The Old Man And The Sea](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2165.The_Old_Man_and_the_Sea) by Ernest Hemingway

An absolute classic that one can devour in one sitting. I actually already knew the story before reading it, but I still got lost in it. It's not just one story, but many small stories on different levels. And some of them I found truly educational. What sticks with me in the end is that sometimes you just have to let go, before paying the price for holding on for too long.

That's it for February. Overall a great month of reading with a heavy focus on novels. I just don't feel like diving into a lot of nonfiction books currently.

What are your reading highlights from this month? Any suggestions what I should pick up next?

See you in March ‚úåÔ∏è
