## To do

In early 2023, I refactored my site to use the new `app/` directory in Next.js 13. I went ahead and shipped it, but there are still a few things I want to do:

-   [ ] Adding analytics with Fathom
-   [x] Adding a footer
-   [ ] Migrating over my portfolio
-   [x] Adding the `/work` site with services like crits and other things
-   [ ] RSS Feed for the blog
-   [ ] Newsletter Signup and notification if new blog posts are live
-   [ ] SEO Optimization and OG image sharing
-   [ ] Like Counter for the Blog Posts
-   [ ] Add a `/uses` site
-   [ ] Add a Hacker News Reader as a fun little side project
-   [ ] Making all links blue?!
-   [ ] Creating a `/work-with-me` site
