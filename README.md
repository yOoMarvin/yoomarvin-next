## Setup

-   **Framework**: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## To do

In early 2023, I refactored my site to use the new `app/` directory in Next.js 13. I went ahead and shipped it, but there are still a few things I want to do:

-   [x] Adding analytics with Vercel
-   [x] Adding a footer
-   [x] Migrating over my portfolio
-   [x] Adding the `/work` site with services like crits and other things
-   [ ] RSS Feed for the blog
-   [ ] SEO Optimization and OG image sharing
-   [ ] Like Counter for the Blog Posts
-   [ ] Add a `/uses` site
-   [ ] Add a Hacker News Reader as a fun little side project
-   [x] Making all links blue?!
